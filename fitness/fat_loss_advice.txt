Here is the post I mentioned above. Context may be a bit off because I mostly just copy pasted from my previous post. 

----

I am a little taller (193cm) and was 15 kg heavier than you, so let me share what's helped me make significant progress, rapidly, even though I'm still on my own journey.

----

Make fitness a part of your identity. Yes, it will feel a bit absurd to do this while you're still obese, but this is a mind-game more than anything. Become obsessive, start talking about fitness to people, make it a part of yourself. 

----

You can lose all or most all of your excess fat in about a year. You can start feeling significant qualitative quality of life improvements in under 2 months. Something that held me back from doing this earlier was thinking on timescales that were far too short. Even though I intellectually understood it would take months, months irrationally felt like an incredibly long time... but now I think about decades regularly in my business, so isn't it absurd to postpone something you've wanted for years just because it will take a few months of trying to see results?

Also, it is very easy to make the mistake of serializing tasks: I will get rich then FIRE then get health in shape then find a partner. Everything gets easier once you start improving your physical health, and it's actually far easier to do than you think it is. It just requires some patience and can be done contemporaneous of other goals. So start building momentum. :) 

----

Consider the engineer's maxim: "What is measured, improves." In some sense, just measuring and tracking weight, calories, protein, and steps walked is all you really need to do. You'll naturally start to change behaviors if you have a goal and you are taking data that shows you out of alignment with that goal. Seriously, don't underestimate this effect. If you do nothing else, just measure.

Also, your weight can easily swing 5+ lbs inside of a day. Multi pound swings between days due to bowel movements, water weight, etc are not uncommon. Just log the weight when you wake up, mechanically. Try not to get too attached to the number. Don't try to "game" the number, because you'll just make it harder for yourself the next day.

----

Get two pairs of shoes with good arch support and alternate between them. Replace the insoles as they get worn out, which will be fast (the mechanical strain on them is cubic or worse with your weight). You do not want to give yourself plantar fasciitis, trust me this investment is worth it. 

----

Experiment with different mattresses. Ensure you don't have sleep apnea. Long periods of bad sleep will cause all sorts of crazy side effects. Even slight sleep disruptions can cause significant changes in body hormones.

----

The sheer scope of misinformation in the fitness / nutrition / health space is unreal. Assume literally everything is full of shit and only get your info from evidence based sources. Even then, they can have an agenda. Assume that you already believe some things that are wrong or not even wrong.

----

Being both obese and tall messes with a lot of standard advice and rules of thumb. Expect to be the exception, not the rule. 

----

Your mileage may vary so if you find something that is working for you, keep doing it even if it isn't exactly in keeping with whatever the wisdom is. Everyone has an opinion about *your* weight loss, and almost all of them are going to be bad opinions, often telling you how you're doing it wrong. When you start having success with your weight loss you will hear a shocking percentage of people tell you you're losing weight too fast, or have lost too much and need to gain weight (even if you're still overweight!). Fuck em, find your own way. When in doubt, talk to an actual expert. I wouldn't even *consider* listening to someone unless they were a medical doctor or they had personally overcome obesity. Even then, what worked for me may not work for you.

----

Weight loss is 80% to 90% dieting, and just 10% to 20% exercise. You can get all the results you want through diet alone, on a calories-in-calories-out basis.

----

Semaglutide (Wegovy, Ozempic, Rybelsus) and Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) have greatly helped many people. Go for it! 

However, let me provide a personal anecdote: I got a prescription for semaglutide, but had difficulty filling the prescription. During the delay I started trying to fix my diet anyways and was shocked to find that I simply didn't get hungry, even if I only ate a third of my maintenance intake. I was fat enough that I was above my upper "set point", so I wasn't getting hungry. I had been eating off of signals other than hunger itself, and eating preemptively out of a fear of hunger (trigger warning) >!which I developed after almost starving to death as a teenager!<. I am now trying to intentionally delay eating until I actually experience hunger. I will get around to filling that prescription but for now I am maintaining a significant caloric deficit without really trying too hard. 

----

The research shows that going to the gym can be counterproductive for weight (fat) loss. Compensatory eating behaviors after more strenuous exercise make maintaining a caloric deficit more challenging, especially for people struggling with disordered eating / obesity. Working out when you are obese can feel gross, and going to the gym as an obese person can be intimidating, making the entire process of weight loss harder than it needs to be and thus less sustainable. You can go to the gym once you're ready.

----

Despite what everyone tells you, muscle does not passively burn more calories than fat in any significant way. The attempts in the literature to investigate this myth *at most* show a single digit percent relative difference, and often fail to show any difference. You will see [maybe 6 C / day of energy per pound of lean muscle](https://www.latimes.com/health/la-xpm-2011-may-16-la-he-fitness-muscle-myth-20110516-story.html) (4 C / day more than fat), meaning that even if you put on a significant amount of muscle (say 20 lbs) the calorie burning will not be significant (say 80 C / day relative to same weight but as fat). This would cause you to lose an extra pound of fat every 44 days; it isn't really how you solve obesity. Walking an extra 10 minutes a day is far more realistic for someone in your situation and might even burn more calories!

----

Recomposition, the simultaneous loss of fat and gain of muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, is really only possible when you meet two criteria: 

1: The caloric deficit is mild, no more than approximately 500 C. 

2: You have sufficient high quality sleep. Even very mild sleep disruptions effectively prevent recombination outright. 

[Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4K0s792wAU). I suspect that once you get going you will be able to sustain a deficit of significantly more than 500 C, which would make you choose between recomposition or faster weight loss. I opted for faster weight loss for reasons I'm sure you understand. Accordingly, going to the gym can be truly more hassle than it is worth at this stage of your journey. It isn't worthless, you can learn good form and maybe get some beginner gains, but don't feel like it is a critical component to weight loss, especially not right now. Once you get much closer to a healthy weight you can start shooting for recomposition and start going to the gym, but there is nothing wrong with just focusing down the weight right now. 

----

Personal anecdote as aside: For context on caloric deficits and why 500 C is so achievable, I have averaged a 2,000 C daily deficit in the recent months and been losing 0.6 lbs a day (18 lbs a month). I have a 2,800 C resting metabolic rate and burn an average of 600 C from walking (which only takes like 75 minutes or so; I listen to audio books, music, or have a phone call while doing this). I eat an average of 1,400 C a day, making sure to get 150g to 200g of protein. Yes, both of my doctors know I am doing this and no it isn't unhealthy. 

If you begin taking serious strides to improve your health, be prepared for a lot of people, including strangers, to suddenly become very "concerned" and try to get you to stop. You will notice none of these people ever voiced their concerns when you were obese. You will be at 25% body fat or above (10% above a good target for men) and have people tell you to *gain* weight! I kid you not.

----

While strenuous exercise can be counterproductive for weight loss, low impact cardio (eg walking) isn't. While walking you burn calories proportional to your weight. In a twisted way, being so heavy is a boon: for every hour of walking you burn about 1.17 C per kg of body weight. You burn nearly twice as many calories walking as a typical person. Use that to your advantage. 

----

Walking fast or jogging or running does not burn all that more calories per hour than walking, despite feeling far more exhausting. Also, there is no real recovery period to walking. Until you feel like you want to do higher impact cardio, it is totally reasonable to simply stick with walking at a natural pace, or maybe a brisk walk. If you want to burn more calories, go a little longer. 

----

Note that if you try to walk faster beware if you are flexing the bottom of your foot too much without proper arch support. You'll give yourself plantar fasciitis and be unable to walk much at all, and recovery is quite slow!

Furthermore, jogging and running is absolute murder on your knees if you're obese: really minimize or eschew jogging / running until you are significantly lighter! 

----

Exercise can cause compensatory decrease in calories burned through NEAT (non-exercise activity thermogenesis; the little things you do throughout the day that don't significantly raise your heart rate). This effect is naturally mitigated if you exercise later in the day, but don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Also, NEAT is almost entirely subconsciously regulated and can't be consciously controlled in a sustainable manner. 

----

For heart health something like 8,000 steps is supposedly a good goal (though the study that comes from was a bit coarse with the data; it may well be higher). This is about 80 minutes of walking (100 steps per minute). Don't view it as a binary though, because you won't do 8,000 every day and some steps sometimes is better than nothing.

----

As long as you don't have a crazy weird diet and eat a reasonable variety of foods, all that really matters are calories and protein. Accordingly, you don't need to totally give up any foods: nothing is truly off limits, it just needs to be understood in context. Maintain a calorie deficit and you'll be fine.

----

Try to eat 1g of protein per cm of height. You may be surprised how much this is: protein is the macronutrient most under-consumed by people. There are different rules of thumb for protein consumption, but this one works well and is best for people who are both tall and obese. [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pok0Jg2JAkE). This will help prevent muscle loss while you are losing weight.

----

I carry my iPhone with me all the time every day, and I use the Apple Health app to record my weight each morning. It automatically tracks my steps, active energy burned, passive energy burned, and many other things. I also use the app MacroFactor to track my food intake. I mention this specifically because it was partly developed by Jeff Nippard, the guy I've been linking in this comment chain, which uses a number of carefully chosen methodologies to support weight loss and fitness in a low pressure, evidence-based way that I really appreciate. 

I don't think you need a watch or other wearable for health tracking purposes, unless you want the heart monitoring stuff.

----

[Watch this evidence-based video about the causes of obesity,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keBZfGAmq2Q) but do yourself a favor and skip the comments. :)

----

Most people eat the same 5-10 meals for 90% of their meals. Just make intentional changes to those 5-10 meals and you'll lose weight.

----

Some numbers I found helpful:

* Fat is 7,700 C / kg to gain or lose. Muscle is 1,540 C / kg. (3500 C / lbs and 700 C / lbs respectively).

* Walking at a natural pace for an hour burns about 1.17 C / kg. (0.35 C / lbs). 

* Someone of your height probably has about 1,275 steps / km (2,050 steps / mi).

* Each 1g of lean protein is 5 C. (Actually it's about 4 C, but there are fats and other stuff in real-world protein sources). This means at your height you should eat about 1,000 C in pure protein a day! I find that much difficult to eat in a day, and use protein shakes that are 160 C / 30g protein to help bring me closer. I cut out my high calorie coffee creamer by just using the protein shake as a creamer.
